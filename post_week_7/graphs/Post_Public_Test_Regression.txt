This model was created after deployment at our service learning partner. It was the model
was producing to high temperature results near the thermal camera. This was corrected
for by adding 1/distance term to the model. The relevent temperature threshold was adjusted ensure
was closer to human skin temperature. This new model data is all listed inside
the folder "/Data3"

Notes:
[1] Standard Errors assume that the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified.
[2] The condition number is large, 1.25e+06. This might indicate that there are
strong multicollinearity or other numerical problems.
